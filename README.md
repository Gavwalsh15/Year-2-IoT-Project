This project aims to address the issue of water wastage. This report will show how my "Smart Tap" IoT project that uses ESP32 to monitor water usage, detect user presence and temperature, and automatically turn off when not in use was made and all the steps, I took along the way. The data collected is transmitted to the website and helps us meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for water efficiency and management of waste. The overall goal of my project is to reduce water waste and promote home sustainability. 

25% of people in Ireland don’t think they need to conserve water because it rains too much, and over 50% know they are wasting water. 
I chose to create the “Smart Tap”, which will monitor water usage and help reduce wastewater. This idea came about after my mother had given out to me for leaving the kitchen tap running waiting to see if there was hot water for a shower. This is when I had decided that I wanted to base my internet of things project off this issue I had run into. 
With the “Smart Tap” the user will be able to auto shut off when left idle and monitor other stats like water usage over a day and temperature. An ESP32 will be the brains of this project this in combination with temperature- senor for temperature, an ultra-sonic sensor to detect if you are at the sink. All this information is sent to a website. 
All these things together help to reach the UN Sustainability goals,
In particular – 
6.4 - By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors.
By reducing the amount of water used in the home we can help reduce water waste
12.4 - By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle. By reducing the amount of water used will reduce the stress on cleaning facility’s and reducing chemicals used overall.
